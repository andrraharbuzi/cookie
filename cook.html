                    With 11 million page views and counting since 2013, these <b>super soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies</b> are the most popular cookie recipe on my website. Melted butter, more brown sugar than white sugar, cornstarch, and an extra egg yolk guarantee the absolute chewiest chocolate chip cookie texture. And you don’t even need a mixer!

                    There are thousands of chocolate chip cookies recipes out there. Everyone has their favorite and this one is mine. Just a glance at the hundreds of reviews in the comments section tells me that this recipe is a favorite for many others too! In fact, if you asked me which recipe to keep in your apron pocket, my answer would be this one. (In addition to a classic cut-out sugar cookies and flaky pie crust, of course!) Just read the comments on a post in our Facebook group. These cookies are loved… and, warning: they disappear FAST.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The recipe is also included in two of my published cookbooks (in Sally’s Baking Addiction, I swap chocolate chips for M&Ms/chocolate chips combo).

                <h2>Key Ingredients for Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    The cookie dough is made from your standard cookie ingredients: flour, leavener, salt, sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla. It’s the <i>ratios</i> and <i>temperature</i> of those ingredients that make this recipe stand out from the rest. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 and 1/4 cups (280g) <b>all-purpose flour (<a href="#">spoon & leveled</a>)</b></li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon <b>baking soda</b></li>
                        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons <b>cornstarch*</b></li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon <b>salt</b></li>
                        <li>3/4 cup (1.5 sticks or 170g) <b>unsalted butter</b>, melted & cooled 5 minutes*</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark <b>brown sugar</b></li>
                        <li>1/2 cup (100g) <b>granulated sugar</b></li>
                        <li>1 large <b>egg</b> + 1 <b>egg yolk</b>, at room temperature</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons <b>pure vanilla extract</b></li>
                        <li>1 and 1/4 cups (225g) <b>semi-sweet chocolate chips</b> or <b>chocolate chunks</b></li>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy. Fold in the chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2–3 hours or up to 3 days. I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Preheat oven to <b>325°F (163°C)</b>. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, measure 3 scant Tablespoons (about 2 ounces, or 60g) of dough for XL cookies or 2 heaping Tablespoons (about 1.75 ounces, or 50g) of dough for medium/large cookies. Roll into a ball, making sure the shape is taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. Repeat with remaining dough. Place 8–9 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bake the cookies for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. (XL cookies can take closer to 14 minutes.) The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, press a few extra chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is optional and only for looks. After 10 minutes of cooling on the baking sheets, transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Notes</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions:</b> You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 2–3 days. Allow to come to room temperature then continue with step 5. Baked cookies freeze well for up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well for up to 3 months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute, no need to thaw. <a href="#">Click here for my tips and tricks</a> on freezing cookie dough.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Cornstarch:</b> If you don’t have cornstarch, you can leave it out. The cookies are still very soft.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Butter:</b> Avoid letting the melted butter cool for too long otherwise your dough will be crumbly instead of soft (and your cookies will end up too puffy). You want it still a little warm. Salted butter can be used instead. Reduce salt in the cookie dough to 1/4 teaspoon.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Egg & Egg Yolk:</b> Room temperature egg + egg yolk are best. Typically, if a recipe calls for room temperature or melted butter, it’s good practice to use room temperature eggs as well. To bring eggs to room temperature quickly, simply place the whole eggs into a glass of warm water for 5 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Can I add nuts or different add-ins?</b> Yes, absolutely. As long as the total amount of add-ins is around 1 – 1 and 1/4 cups, you can add anything including chopped nuts, M&Ms, white chocolate chips, dried cranberries, chopped peanut butter cups, etc. You could even add 1/2 cup (80g) sprinkles to make a sprinkle chocolate chip cookie.
